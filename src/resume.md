I'm a JS hacker, with a strong interest in product design, especially designing [Tools for Thought](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424084.Tools_for_Thought) and new modes of expression through technology. I'm also skilled at system design and working with AWS and Cloudflare.

I'm looking for teams who are building interesting products, but also maintaining good work-life balance. I'm interested in part-time roles or potentially full-time roles if hours are flexible and the team dynamic is good.

## Some of my experiences

### HubSpot

Tech Lead | January 2024 - June 2025

Learned to manage a team including running meetings, managing performance in a large organization and bring actionability to nebulous goals. We designed and launched an internal product that teams across the org used successfully everyday. Also learned that management is not my favorite type of role, I'd prefer to be an IC and help team members through collaboration, and so left the role earlier this year.

### Kumospace

Software Engineer | June 2023 - July 2024

Helped Kumospace build their virtual office product. I loved the team dynamic at Kumospace. Even though we were remote, the virtual office product we were working on helped reduce meeting fatigue and created a virtual space to hang out casually. I shipped many things I was proud of, but came away from this role appreciating the healthy workplace culture most of all.

### Noir Gallery (Now Framer.art)

Partner / Tech Founder | January 2020 - August 2021

I met a photographer in LA who had started to sell his own art prints and the prints of other artists from around the world, and partnered up with him to automate his business. We built portal allowing artists to upload their work, integrations to list their work on sites including Etsy, Overstock and our own svelte-based e-commerce site, photo editing tools to help with fulfillment and automation to submit orders to our printing partners. I left to work on new projects in 2021, the platform continues to operate at https://framer.art
