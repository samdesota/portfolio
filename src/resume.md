# Sam DeSota

Brooklyn, NY | sam@438d.xyz | github.com/samdesota

I'm a web hacker with a strong interest in product design. I'm inspired by software that creates new mediums of expression and like games, editors, DAWs and communication platforms. I'm also skilled at system design and working with AWS and Cloudflare.

I'm looking for teams who are building interesting products, but also maintaining good work-life balance. I'm interested in part-time roles or potentially full-time roles if hours are flexible and the team dynamic is good.

Some tech I've worked with: *React, SolidJS, Tailwind, Cloudflare Workers, Lambda, MySQL, Mongo, AWS Athena, Svelte, Next.js, Terraform, GH Actions, Bun, JS / Typescript, CSS, Clojure, Rust, Swift, Java, Docker, Nix, Cursor, Cline, Claude Code*

## Some of my experiences

### HubSpot

Tech Lead II | January 2024 - June 2025

Learned to manage a team including running meetings, managing performance in a large organization and bring actionability to nebulous goals. We designed and launched an internal product that teams across the org used successfully everyday. Also learned that management is not my favorite type of role, I'd prefer to be an IC and help team members through collaboration, and so left the role earlier this year.

### Kumospace

Senior Software Engineer | June 2023 - July 2024

Helped Kumospace build their virtual office product. I loved the team dynamic at Kumospace. Even though we were remote, the virtual office product we were working on helped reduce meeting fatigue and created a virtual space to hang out casually. I shipped many things I was proud of, but came away from this role appreciating the healthy workplace culture most of all.
